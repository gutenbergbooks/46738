<h2>ROBERT'S PICTER.</h2>

<p>By some stordinary mistake on the part of
some wery hemenent taker of Poortraits, I
was last week requested for to go to him and
set for my Picter.</p>

<div class="figleft w25">
  <a href="images/145b.png">
  <img src="images/145b.png"
  alt="Illustration" /></a>
</div>

<p>He told me in his letter that his reason for wanting me to set to him
was, becoz he wanted to have the Picters of all the Members of the
Copperation, and of course they wood not be complete without mine, for
tho of course he knew that I was not a real Common Counseller, still, he
thort that I had left sitch a mark among them by my ten years constant
service and unwarying atention to em, that the hole matter woud be
wanting in completeness if my Picter was omitted, even if it was only as
"Mr. <span class="smcap">Robert</span> the City Waiter" a leading off the presession or a bringing
up the Reer! I remembers werry well when the other City Picter was
printed, about a year ago, when the <span class="smcap">Lord Mare's</span> three Footmen, all in
their werry hansumest uniforms, was placed exactly in the front, and all
being fine hansum fellers, as they undowtedly is, they were thort to
have taken the shine out of the hole Picter, but that was in course
quite a diffrent thing, and this new one is to be quite werry diffrent
from that one, and carried out in quite another style altogether, and
will, I shoud think, atract such uniwersal admiration as will quite cut
out the Picter Gallery as was shown at Gildall last summer.</p>

<p>Sum few of the werry hansumest of the hole
Court as has bin and got taken already, has
bin and stuck theirselves up in the Reading
Room, and werry proud they is of their apperience,
and <span class="smcap">Brown</span> and Me has got sum of
the Atendents to let us go in before the
Members comes, and see em privately. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>
says as how as he's quite sure as there must
be sum mistake about me, becoz as he carn't
at all see how I shoud fit in with the rest.
But there's werry little dout in my mind that
it's all a case of gelosy with <span class="smcap">Brown</span>, who
woud werry much like to have sitch a chance.</p>

<hr />

<p>I had my chance of going yesterday, and
werry kind the Gennelman wos who took me,
and he took me three times, to make sure of
me. He said as I was a werry good Setter,
and that everybody woud know who I was by
my likenesses in <i>Punch</i>, and lots of peeple
woud like to git my Picter, as it was a
werry good likeness.</p>

<p class="center">PART XIII.&mdash;WHAT'S IN A NAME?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Scene XXII.</span>&mdash;<i>At the Supper-table in the Housekeeper's Room.</i>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pomfret</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span> <i>are at the head and foot of the
table respectively</i>. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span> <i>is between</i> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pomfret</span> <i>and</i>
Miss <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>. <i>The Steward's Room Boy waits.</i></p>

<p><i>Tredwell.</i> I don't see Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span> here this evening, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pomfret</span>.
What's the reason of that?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfret.</i> Why, he asked to be excused to-night, Mr. <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span>.
You see some of the visitors' coachmen are putting up their
horses here, and he's helping Mr. <span class="smcap">Checkley</span> entertain them.
(<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>.) Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span> is our Stud-Groom, and him and
Mr. <span class="smcap">Checkley</span>, the 'ed coachman, are very friendly just now.
<span class="smcap">Adams</span> is very clever with his horses, I believe, and I'm sure he'd
have liked a talk with you; it's a pity he's engaged elsewhere this
evening.</p>

<p><i>Undershell (mystified).</i> I&mdash;I'm exceedingly sorry to have missed
him, Ma'am. (<i>To himself.</i>) Is the Stud-Groom <i>literary</i>, I wonder?...
Ah, no, I remember now; I allowed Miss <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span> to
conclude that my tastes were equestrian. Perhaps it's just as well
the Stud-Groom <i>isn't</i> here!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfr.</i> Well, he <i>may</i> drop in later on. I shouldn't be
surprised if you and he
had met before.</p>

<p><i>Und. (to himself). I</i> should. (<i>Aloud.</i>) I hardly think it's
probable.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfr.</i> I've known stranger things than <i>that</i> happen. Why, only
the other day, a gentleman came into this very room, as it might be
yourself, and it struck me he was looking very hard at me, and by-and-by
he says, "You don't recollect <i>me</i>, Ma'am, but I know <i>you</i> very well,"
says he. So I said to him, "You certainly have the advantage of me at
present, Sir." "Well, Ma'am," he says, "many years ago I had the honour

and privilege of being Steward's Room Boy in a house where you
was Stillroom Maid; and I consider I owe the position I have since
attained entirely to the good advice you used to give me, as I've
never forgot it, Ma'am," says he. Then it flashed across me who it
was&mdash;"Mr. <span class="smcap">Pocklington</span>!!!" says I. Which it <i>were</i>. And him
own man to the Duke of <span class="smcap">Dumbleshire</span>! Which was what made it
so very nice and 'andsome of him to remember me all that time.</p>

<p><i>Und. (perfunctorily).</i> It must have been most gratifying, Ma'am.
(<i>To himself.</i>) I hope this old lady hasn't any more anecdotes of this
highly interesting nature. I mustn't neglect Miss <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>&mdash;especially
as I haven't very long to stay here.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He consults his watch stealthily.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Miss Phillipson (observing the action).</i> I'm sorry you find it
so slow here; it's not very polite of you to show it quite so openly
though, I must say.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She pouts.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Und. (to himself).</i> I can't let this poor girl think me a brute!
But I must be careful not to go too far. (<i>To her, in an undertone
which he tries to render unemotional.</i>) Don't misunderstand me
like that. If I looked at my watch, it was merely to count the
minutes that are left. In one short half hour I must go&mdash;I must
pass out of your life, and you must forget&mdash;oh, it will be easy for
<i>you</i>&mdash;but for <i>me</i>, ah! you cannot think that I shall carry away
a heart entirely unscathed. Believe me I shall always look back
gratefully, regretfully, on&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Phill. (bending her head with a gratified little giggle).</i> I declare
you're beginning all that <i>again</i>. I never <i>did</i> see such a cure as you are.</p>

<p><i>Und. (to himself, displeased).</i> I wish she could bring herself to
take me a little more seriously. I can <i>not</i> consider it a compliment
to be called a "cure"&mdash;whatever that is.</p>

<p><i>Steptoe (considering it time to interfere).</i> Come, Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>
all this whispering reelly is not fair on the company! You mustn't
hide your bushel under a napkin like this; don't reserve <i>all</i> your
sparklers for Miss <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span> there.</p>

<p><i>Und. (stiffly).</i> I&mdash;ah&mdash;was not making any remark that could be
described as a sparkler, Sir. I <i>don't</i> sparkle.</p>

<p><i>Phill. (demurely).</i> He was being rather sentimental just then,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Steptoe</span>, as it happens. Not that he can't sparkle, when he
likes. I'm sure if you'd heard how he went on in the fly!</p>

<p><i>Steptoe (with malice).</i> Not having been privileged to be present,
perhaps our friend here could recollect a few of the best and repeat
them.</p>

<p><i>Miss Dolman.</i> Do, Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>, please. I do <i>love</i> a good
laugh.</p>

<p><i>Und. (crimson).</i> I&mdash;you really must excuse me. I said nothing
worth repeating. I don't remember that I was particularly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Stept.</i> Pardon me. Afraid I was indiscreet. We must spare Miss
<span class="smcap">Phillipson's</span> blushes by all manner of means.</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> Oh, it was nothing of <i>that</i> sort, Mr. <span class="smcap">Steptoe</span>! <i>I</i>'ve no
objection to repeat what he said. He called me a little green something
or other. No; he said <i>that</i> in the train, though. But he would
have it that the old cab-horse was a magic steed, and the fly an enchanted
chariot; and I don't know what all. (<i>As nobody smiles.</i>)
It sounded awfully funny as <i>he</i> said it, with his face perfectly
solemn like it is now, I assure you it did!</p>

<p><i>Stept. (patronisingly).</i> I can readily believe it. We shall have
you contributing to some of our yumerous periodicals, Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>,
Sir, before long. Such facetious talent is too good to be
lost, it reelly is.</p>

<p><i>Und. (to himself, writhing).</i> I gave her credit for more sense. To
make me publicly ridiculous like this!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He sulks.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Miss Stickler</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">M. Ridevos</span>, <i>who suddenly rises</i>). <span class="smcap">Mossoo</span>, you're
not <i>going</i>! Why, whatever's the matter?</p>

<p><i>M. Ridevos.</i> Pairmeet zat I make my depart. I am cot at ze art.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>General outcry and sensation.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfr. (concerned).</i> You never mean that, Mossoo? And a nice dish
of quails just put on, too, that they haven't even touched upstairs!</p>

<p><i>M. Rid.</i> It is for zat I do not remmain! Zey 'ave not toch him; my
pyramide, result of a genius stupend, énorme! to zem he is nossing; zey
retturn him to crash me! To-morrow I demmand zat Miladi accept my

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>He leaves the room precipitately.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Miss Stick. (offering to rise).</i> It <i>does</i> seem to have upset him!
Shall I go after him and see if I can't bring him round?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfr. (severely).</i> Stay where you are, <span class="smcap">Harriet</span>; he's better
left to himself. If he wasn't so wropped up in his cookery, he'd
know there's always a dish as goes the round untasted, without why
or wherefore. I've no <i>patience</i> with the man!</p>

<p><i>Tred. (philosophically).</i> That's the worst of 'aving to do with
Frenchmen; they're so apt to beyave with a sutting childishness
that&mdash;(<i>checking himself</i>)&mdash;I really ask your pardon, Mamsell, I
quite forgot you was of his nationality; though it ain't to be wondered
at, I'm sure, for you might pass for an Englishwoman almost
anywhere!</p>

<p><i>Mlle. Chiffon.</i> As you for Frenchman, <i>hein</i>?</p>

<p><i>Tred.</i> No, 'ang it <i>all</i>, Mamsell, I 'ope there's no danger o' <i>that</i>!
(<i>To</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>.) Delighted to see the Countess keeps as fit as
ever, Miss <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>! Wonderful woman for her time o' life!
Law, she <i>did</i> give the Bishop beans at dinner, and no mistake!</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> Her ladyship is pretty generous with them to most people,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span>. I'm sure I'd have left her long ago, if it wasn't
for Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>&mdash;who <i>is</i> a lady, if you like!</p>

<p><i>Tred.</i> She don't favour her ma, I will say <i>that</i> for her. By the
way, who is the party they brought down with them? a youngish
looking chap&mdash;seemed a bit out of his helement, when he first come in,
though he's soon got over that, judging by the way him and your
Lady <span class="smcap">Rhoda</span>, Miss <span class="smcap">Dolman</span>, was 'obnobbing together at table!</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> Nobody came down with <i>my</i> ladies; they must have met
him in the bus, I expect. What is his name?</p>

<p><i>Tred.</i> Why, he give it to me, I know, when I enounced him; but
it's gone clean out of my head again. He's got the Verney Chamber,
I know <i>that</i> much; but what <i>was</i> his name again? I shall forget
my own next.</p>

<p><i>Und. (involuntarily).</i> In the Verney Chamber? Then the name
must be <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p><i>Phill. (starting).</i> <span class="smcap">Spurrell!</span> Why, <i>I</i> used to&mdash;&mdash; But of course
it can't be <i>him</i>!</p>

<p><i>Tred.</i> <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> <i>was</i> the name, though. (<i>With a resentful glare
at</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>.) I don't know how <i>you</i> came to be aware of it, Sir!</p>

<p><i>Und.</i> Why, the fact is, I happened to find out that&mdash;(<i>here he receives
an admonitory drive in the back from the</i> Boy)&mdash;that his name
<i>was</i> <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>. (<i>To himself.</i>) I wish this infernal Boy wouldn't be
so officious; but perhaps he's right!</p>

<p><i>Tred.</i> Ho, indeed! Well, <i>another</i> time, Mr. <span class="smcap">Hundershell</span>, if you
require information about parties staying with Us, p'r'aps you'll be
good enough to apply to me personally, instead of picking it up in
some 'ole and corner fashion. (<span class="smcap">Undershell</span> <i>controls his indignation
with difficulty</i>.) To return to the individual in question, Miss
<span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>, I should have said myself he was something in the
artistic or littery way; he suttingly didn't give me the impression
of being a Gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Phill. (to herself, relieved).</i> Then it <i>isn't</i> my <span class="smcap">Jem</span>! I might have
known he wouldn't be visiting here, and carrying on with Lady
<span class="smcap">Rhodas</span>. He'd never forget himself like that&mdash;if he <i>has</i> forgotten me!</p>

<p><i>Stept.</i> It strikes me he's more of a sporting character, <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span>.
I know when I was circulating with the cigarettes, and so on, in the
hall just now, he was telling the Captain some anecdote about an old
steeplechaser that was faked up to win a Selling Handicap, and it
tickled me to that extent I could hardly hold the spirit-lamp steady!</p>

<p><i>Tred.</i> I may be mistook, <span class="smcap">Steptoe</span>. All <i>I</i> can say is, that when
me and <span class="smcap">James</span> was serving cawfy to the ladies in the drawing-room,
some of them had got 'old of a little pink book all sprinkled over
with silver cutlets, and, rightly <i>or</i> wrongly, I took it to 'ave some
connection with 'im.</p>

<p><i>Und. (excitedly).</i> Pink and silver! Might I ask&mdash;was it a volume
of poetry, called&mdash;er&mdash;<i>Andromeda</i>?</p>

<p><i>Tred. (crushingly).</i> That I did not take the liberty of inquiring,
Sir, as you might be aware if you was a little more familiar with the
hetiquette of good Serciety.</p>

<blockquote>

whom he converses</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Und. (to himself).</i> To think that they may be discussing my book
in the drawing-room at this very moment, while I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He
chokes.</i>) Ah, it won't bear thinking of! I must&mdash;I <i>will</i> get out of
this cursed place! I have stood this too long as it is! But I won't
go till I have seen this fellow <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, and made him give me back
my things. What's the time?... Ten! I can go at last. (<i>He rises.</i>)
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pomfret</span>, will you kindly excuse me? I&mdash;I find I must go at once.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfr.</i> Well, Mr. <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>, Sir, you're the best judge;
and, if you really can't stop, this is Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>, who'll take you
round to the stables himself, and do anything that's necessary.
Won't you, Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>?</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> So you're off to-night, Sir, are you? Well, I'd rather ha'
shown you <i>Deerfoot</i> by daylight, myself; but there, I dessay that
won't make much difference to <i>you</i>, so long as you <i>do</i> see the 'orse?</p>

<p><i>Und. (to himself).</i> So <i>Deerfoot's</i> a <i>horse</i>! One of the features of
Wyvern, I suppose; they seem very anxious I shouldn't miss it.
<i>I</i> don't want to see the beast; but I daresay it won't take many
minutes; and, if I don't humour this man, I shan't get a conveyance
to go away in! (<i>Aloud.</i>) No difference whatever&mdash;to <i>me</i>.
I shall be delighted to be shown <i>Deerfoot</i>; only I really can't wait

<h2>"LOST RINGS."</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have seen some letters in the <i>Daily Graphic</i> on the above
subject. A much more curious thing happened to me on April 1, 1887,
at twenty-five minutes past ten in the morning. I dropped a pin
about four yards from the south-western corner of the Marble Arch.
It is almost incredible that exactly three years later I picked up a
pin, at 4.17 in the afternoon, three yards and seven and a quarter inches
to the south-east of the Humane Society's Receiving House. I have
studied carefully the levels of the ground, the flow of the surface
water, and the direction of the prevailing air currents, and I am
reluctantly forced to the conclusion that it was <i>not</i> the same pin.
Had it been, I should have found it five and a half inches further
north. The question now is, whose pin was it?&mdash;Your obedient
servant,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Some weeks ago I rode outside an omnibus from
Piccadilly Circus to Charing Cross. Getting down hastily, when I
found that it went on to Westminster instead of the City, I left
behind a large grey parrot in a cage, a siphon of soda-water, and a
St. Bernard dog. Yesterday, when I climbed on to an omnibus
following the same route, I found my cage, my siphon, and my dog!
It was the same omnibus, and the faithful beast was still there.
Unfortunately the parrot and the soda-water were not, for the
sagacious animal had evidently made use of them to sustain life,
not very satisfactorily, for he was a mere skeleton.</p>

<h2>JAP THE GIANT-KILLER.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Fragment of a Tale of New Japan as told around a Fire-Brazier in
Dai Nippon.</i>)</p>

<hr />

<p>Once upon a time in the Happy Dragon-fly shaped Land of the
Rising Sun there lived a little hero named <span class="smcap">Jap</span>. Small he was, but
valiant as <span class="smcap">Také-no-uchi-no-sukuné</span> himself of the long life and
many-syllabled name. He was a dead hand at dragon slaying, and
had killed more tigers than <span class="smcap">Hadésu</span>. He could exorcise Oni like one
o'clock, these demons or imps having an exceeding bad time of it
when <span class="smcap">Jap</span> was, as he would term it, "on the job." In fact, his
exploits were the favourite topic of talk when young and old gathered
around the hibachi, or fire-braziers, to list to tales of heroism, filial
piety, and Pro-Gress. Pro-Gress was the name of the great new
goddess of whom <span class="smcap">Jap</span> was a votary. From her he had received the
gift of a new "sword of sharpness," which would not only, like
the gift of the triple-headed Cornish giant, "cut through anything,"
but would make all enemies cut <i>like</i> anything.</p>

<p>Little <span class="smcap">Jap</span>, having acquired this wonderful sword, compared with
which that which <span class="smcap">Nitta</span> threw into the sea was a mere oyster-knife,
was naturally desirous of using it. He kept it as sharp as that of
the great demon-queller <span class="smcap">Shō-ki</span>; but the demons he quelled with
it were the great obstructive ogres known as Kon-serva-tism,
Fogi-ism and Pre-ju-dice. <span class="smcap">Jap</span> gave those antiquated bogies
beans. The Tengus and Shō-jos had a bad time of it, you bet, and
the "bag" of Dragons, or Tatsus, <span class="smcap">Jap</span> could show after one of his
regular "battues" was a caution to Saurians, I can assure you!
He had a collection of Tatsu-teeth that would have aroused the
envy of <span class="smcap">Cadmus</span>, and given <span class="smcap">Jason</span> a high-toned job. As to that
terrible wild-fowl, the Ho-ho bird, with "the head of a pheasant,
the beak of a swallow, the neck of a tortoise, and the outward
semblance of a dragon," <span class="smcap">Jap</span>, with his "gun of swiftness" (another
gift of his favourite goddess) knocked the Ho-hos over right and left, as
though they were really pheasants in a swell British preserve; and it
was commonly said that when <span class="smcap">Jap</span> had a day among the Ho-hos, there
was a glut in the Toyoakitsu poultry market for a fortnight after.</p>

<p>But <span class="smcap">Jap</span>, in time, grew tired of the common or cherry-garden Ho-ho,
and aweary of such small sport as mere dragons and demons could
furnish. He yearned like an Anglo-Indian Shikari for big game!</p>

<p>Now there was an ugly, but enormous giant, fierce-looking as
Kaminari, the Thunder-god, old as Urashima, the Kami-no-kuni
<i>Rip Van Winkle</i>, strong as Asaina Saburō, the Dai Nippon Hercules,
big as Fusi-yama, "the matchless mountain," rich as the
Treasure Ship, laden with Ta-kara-mono (or "Precious Things"),
stubborn, stolid, and unprogressive as Kamé, the hairy-tailed
tortoise, himself. This tremendous Tartar-Mongolian Blunderbore
had a number of fine names, of flowery flavour and Celestial
swaggersomeness, but we will call him <span class="smcap">Jon-ni</span>, for short.</p>

<p>Now Little <span class="smcap">Jap</span> hated Big <span class="smcap">Jon-ni</span>, and Big <span class="smcap">Jon-ni</span> disdained
Little <span class="smcap">Jap</span>, as indeed he disdained everybody else save his conceited
and colossal self. <span class="smcap">Jap</span> curled his lip at <span class="smcap">Jon-ni</span>; <span class="smcap">Jon-ni</span> put out his
tongue at <span class="smcap">Jap</span> like a China figure; when the duodecimo hero bit his
thumb at the elephantine Celestial, the elephantine Celestial cocked a
snook at the duodecimo hero. This could not last. Little <span class="smcap">Jap</span> was
ambitious to try his sword of sharpness and his gun of swiftness
upon big game. He cried, "By the heroic Hidésato who slew the
giant Centipede, I will have a slap at this bouncing <i>Bobadil</i> of a
wooden-headed, grandmother-worshipping, old Stick-in-the-mud!"</p>

<p>Some of his more timid friends tried to dissuade him. "Beware,
<span class="smcap">Jap</span>," they cried, "this Chinese Blunderbore is too big for thee!"
"Pooh!" retorted the undaunted <span class="smcap">Jap</span>. "Remember

<span class="poetry">
  <span class="poem">
    <span class="stanza">
      <span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;'the valiant Cornishman</span>
      <span class="i0">Who slew the giant Cormoran.'</span>
    </span>
  </span>
</span>

Am I not as big as <span class="smcap">Jack</span> now, and as fit to play the Giant-killer
as he? Too big? Why, the overgrown monster is like the Buddhist
Daruma, who, 'arriving in China in the sixth century, at once went
into a state of abstraction, which extended over nine years, during
which time he never moved; and as a result lost the use of his legs.'
Only <span class="smcap">Jon-ni</span> has been 'in a state of abstraction' for nine centuries
instead of nine years, and has lost the use of his head, as well as his
legs! He hates and scorns my tutelary goddess, Pro-Gress. I will
try the effect of her gifts upon him! Here goes!!!"</p>

<hr />

<p>His admiring friends dubbed him "<span class="smcap">Jap</span> the Giant-Killer" at
once. And, indeed, when he "went for" that clumsy Colossus,
who in physical proportions out-Chang'd <span class="smcap">Chang</span> himself, the result
of the first round, in which the swaggersome <span class="smcap">Jon-ni</span> was fairly
beaten to his knees, seemed to justify the title. But giants are not
usually "knocked out" in one round, and&mdash;well, my children, tiny
<span class="smcap">Jap's</span> further fortunes in his fight with Titan <span class="smcap">Jon-ni</span>, may furnish
material for further narrative when next we gather around the
glowing hibachi to tell tales of <span class="smcap">Jap</span> the Giant-Killer!

<h2>A DAY'S RIDE, A LAW'S ROMANCE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>A Story of the Long Vacation.</i>)</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Briefless</span>," said an eminent solicitor to me the other
day, "I want you to go to East Babbleton, in Guiltshire, to see
if the Great Gooseberry Will case is still open. It is a matter of
vital importance, and I shall be glad if you can attend to it
to-morrow."</p>

<p>Referring to <span class="smcap">Portington</span>, I found that my diary was clear for
the day specified, and I expressed my willingness to carry out my
client's instructions.</p>

<p>"I must know at once," continued the gentleman, "because I
desire to bring the matter before the Vacation Judge on an originating
summons. I need scarcely add, that you will get the fullest
particulars from the parish clerk."</p>

<p>Although rather imperfectly instructed, I determined to visit East
Babbleton. The usual sources of railway information led me to
believe that the place was six or seven miles distant from Nearvices
in Guiltshire. I determined to go to Nearvices, taking with me my two
lads (home for the holidays), <span class="smcap">George Lewis Herschell</span> and <span class="smcap">Edward
Clarke Russell</span>. Before now I have explained that my sons'
Christian names have been selected with a view to assisting (in after
years) their professional advancement. We had to start at an
unusually early hour from London, and after enjoying the companionship
of some sportsmen, who talked about "duck" and
"roots" for a quarter of a day, arrived at Nearvices at eleven
o'clock. I made at once for the Red Lion, the principal hotel
in the town. My sons followed me, eager for breakfast. Until then,
they had satisfied their appetite by the stealthy consumption of
about half-a-pound of a sweetmeat that is, I believe, known as
Japanese Almond Rock.</p>

<p>The "Red Lion" was in a state of great commotion. There were
people in high hats at the door, people in high hats looking out of
the coffee-room window, people in high hats thronging the hall. With
some trouble my lads and I got our breakfast, then I asked for the
ostler. He came to me after a pause and awaited my orders.</p>

<p>"I want a trap to take me over to East Babbleton," I said; "and
should like to know how much it will cost."</p>

<p>"Very sorry, Sir, but, I can't do it for you. All the carriages in
the house are hired. You know, Sir, Miss <span class="smcap">Smith</span> is going to be
married, and consequently you can't get a conveyance for love or
money."</p>

<p>I was seriously annoyed, as the instructions of my client were
explicit.</p>

<p>"I really must get over," I said emphatically; "surely Miss
<span class="smcap">Smith</span> can lend us one of her carriages. You might ask her future
husband."</p>

<p>"Can't do that. Sir," replied the ostler; "for we none of us know
him. However, I'll see what can be done for you. Could you drive
yourself over?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>do</i> Papa," shouted my two sons in an ecstasy of delight.
"It would be <i>such</i> fun! and mother isn't here to stop you."</p>

<p>"Well, I will have a shot at it," I returned; "although truth to
tell I am a little rusty. I have not driven for some time."</p>

<p>The ostler eyed me rather sharply, and retired. I then thought it
my duty to reprove my sons for their ill-timed levity, explaining that
their tomfoolery might have caused the ostler to refuse to entrust his
equipage to my care.</p>

<p>"But you have never driven in your life?" said <span class="smcap">George Lewis
Herschell</span>. "Have you, Papa?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say that I have," I replied, with that truthfulness
which is the characteristic of my dealings in the domestic circle.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a game!" shouted <span class="smcap">Edward Clarke Russell</span>, roaring
with laughter.</p>

<p>Severely chiding my offspring, I proceeded to the hall door. The
ostler had been as good as his word. There was certainly a
conveyance.</p>

<p>"It is not very showy, Sir," said the proprietor; "but I think it
will last a dozen of miles or so."</p>

<p>It was a small dog-cart, which conjured up visions of the toy
waggon-and-horse department in the Lowther Arcade. There was a
horse in the shafts. The harness was imperfect, and the collar
showed its straw. However, I took my seat, and the boys got up
beside me. Then, amidst the good wishes of the wedding party
watching our progress, I started. The horse immediately took up a
course over the pavement, and no doubt aware that the illuminating
power at East Babbleton was primitive, attempted to
carry with him a lamp-post. We cannoned off the pavement into
the middle of the road, and were fairly "off."</p>

<p>"If you boys laugh any more," I said, with the utmost severity,
"I will turn you out and leave you."</p>

<p>"But Papa, if mother could only see us!" cried the pair, and
then they indulged in apparently unextinguishable bursts of
merriment.</p>

<p>I had no further time for remonstrance, as the brute of a horse,
after beginning in a trot, had suddenly quickened its pace to a mad
gallop. And as it did this I noticed that a dust-cart was just in
front of us. I dragged at the reins, and with almost superhuman
exertions brought the beast to a full stop.</p>

<p>"Which is the way to East Babbleton?" I asked, to explain my
rather abrupt pull-up. "Am I taking the right road?"</p>

<p>The dustman looked at me, at the horse, smiled, and answered in
the affirmative. Seeing that we were now about to descend a hill, I
got down and led the horse by its bridle. The brute resented the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
attention. So far as I could judge, without being an expert in
horse-flesh, it seemed to me to be suffering from tooth-ache. It shook
its head when I touched it, and appeared to be disinclined to go
further.</p>

<p>"Do get in, Papa," said <span class="smcap">Edward Clarke Russell</span>. "Perhaps he
will go all right if you leave him alone."</p>

<p>Adopting my son's advice, I mounted the cart, and once again
jerked the reins. The beast began at a trot, and then, as before,
commenced a mad gallop. We rapidly left Nearvices behind us, and
brought ourselves to a stop in front of a haystack.</p>

<p>"You see," I said, "the brute is open to reason. It was stopped
by an obstruction. Seeing the futility of further progress, it
desisted in its running."</p>

<p>"But look, Papa, at that," cried <span class="smcap">George Lewis Herschell</span>,
pointing to what seemed to be the remains of a coal cart. The wheels
were off, the black diamonds were scattered about in all directions,
and the shafts were broken.</p>

<p>"Was that an accident?" I asked an old man who was lighting
his pipe. The venerable individual paused, looked at the pipe,
looked at the pieces of the cart, and looked at me. Then he rubbed
the right side of his head with the palm of his right hand.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, it was," he admitted, in an accent I cannot reproduce;
but added, in a tone that suggested that mishaps of a similar character
occurred on the average every five minutes; "but <i>that</i> accident
happened near an hour ago."</p>

<p>This intelligence rather damped my ardour, and I immediately got
off the cart and insisted upon leading the brute down the next hill.
The animal protested, and shook its head. Remembering its
possible tooth-ache, I treated it with increased courtesy, telling it
to "Gee-up" and "be a good horse." I am sorry to say that the
creature did not seem inclined to acknowledge my kindness.</p>

<p>Having come to a level piece of road, I once more mounted into
the Lowther Arcade dog-cart, and urged on my partially wild
career. I had passed a four-winged post at cross roads, and had
followed the sign pointing to "Babbleton." I had got safely up to
a farm-house, having restrained <i>en route</i> an inclination on the part
of my horse to commit suicide by jumping over the parapet of a
bridge into a small mountain torrent.</p>

<p>"Is this the way to East Babbleton?" I asked a rather cheery,
rosy-cheeked dame, who had been watching our man&oelig;uvres with
a kindly smile, not entirely exempt from good-natured apprehension.</p>

<p>"No, this is not the road, Master," she returned, in the same
unapproachable dialect. "You ought to have borne to the left when
you came to the cross-roads."</p>

<p>Seeing that I had to go back, I seized each of the reins and called
upon my beast of a horse to make an effort. The noble animal
answered bravely to the call, and managed to turn round on a space of
turf about the size of a waggon wheel. It was really a very clever
performance, and had it been seen by Mr. <span class="smcap">Ritchie</span>, I fancy would
have secured for us a lucrative engagement for a "side show" at the
Royal Westminster Aquarium.</p>

<p>"Well, that was a shave surely," said the dame of the cheery
countenance; "when I saw your off wheel go up in the air and hang
over the ditch I thought it would be all up with ye."</p>

<p>Accepting the compliment with dignified geniality, I asked our
fair critic if she could bait our horse.</p>

<p>"Well, I can give him a handful of hay," said the lady; "but I
would not take him out of the shafts for worlds. If I untied him I
could not put him together again."</p>

<p>Refreshed by the nourishment, our steed started again, and after
retracing our steps and nearly upsetting a hay cart, and narrowly
running down a pig, we reached East Babbleton in fairly good condition.
I looked at my watch and found that we had done the six miles in
two hours and a quarter. Having transacted my business, I now
turned the nose of my steed homewards. I had noticed with some
alarm that I had only an hour to get back to Nearvices if I wanted to
catch the train for London. This being so, I saw it was absolutely
necessary that I should act with decision. I held a council of war
with my two sons, and we came to the conclusion that we must get
back as fast at we could, and when there was a difficulty, risk it. We
entered our conveyance and started.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the experience. It was absolutely delightful.
Giving <i>Flora</i> (I came to the conclusion that my steed with the tooth-ache
must have been called <i>Flora</i>) her head, I urged her to progress
as rapidly as possible. The mare promptly answered to the call. I
said "chick," and she started off at a mad gallop. We absolutely
flew up-hill, down-hill, and would no doubt have entered "my lady's
chamber" had not the adjoining cottages been occupied by rustics.
At our approach children, ducks, dogs and gipsies fled in terror. We
boldly cannoned against waggons and shook milestones to their very
foundations. I had long since forgotten my nervousness, and had
assumed an air that would have been becoming in an individual
nicknamed (let us say) "down the road Billy."</p>

<p>I urged <i>Flora</i> to "gee up," by suggesting that "five o'clock tea"
was waiting for her on her arrival at Nearvices. My two sons,
<span class="smcap">George Lewis Herschell</span> and <span class="smcap">Edward Clarke Russell</span>, also
rendered valuable assistance by waving their straw hats, and singing
comic songs with a vehemence that rendered the ballads undistinguishable
from war ditties. As we entered Nearvices, <i>Flora</i>
stumbled, and all but fell. However, with wonderful skill, I picked
her up at the end of my reins, and urged her to fresh exertions by a
feeble flick of the whip, that expended its force on the shafts and a
part of the collar. Again we flew on. We renewed our acquaintance
with the attractive lamp-post, we crossed the sharp curve of the
familiar pavement, we collided against the monument to a worthy in
the market-place, and drove up with a jerk in front of the "Red
Lion." I looked again at my watch; we had done the six miles in
twenty-two minutes. Considering the hills, dales, and obstructive
milestones, a very fair record.</p>

<p>"What, you have come back!" exclaimed the landlady of the "Red
Lion." "Why, we never expected to see you."</p>

<p>I found subsequently that the wedding party, after watching our
departure, had taken bets about our probable return. The most
popular wager seemed to be that we should reappear after midnight
with a wheel, a bit of harness, and the whip, but without the
quadruped.</p>

<p>I have nothing further to relate save this. That after my recent
success I am thinking seriously of giving up the Bar and taking to
the road. If I can raise the required capital, I think I shall run a
four-horse coach between the Temple and Turnham Green. Both
my boys are anxious to give up their school to act as my guard.</p>

<p>By the way, I may add in conclusion that the parish clerk of East
Babbleton declared that he had never heard (until I mentioned it) of
the Great Gooseberry Will Case. So I suppose that my client must
have been wrong in his details.</p>
